# TRF

Implementation of the TRF

Our group ran our data with 5 different models. As a base model our group has tested with Mixed Von Mises. As a comparison models, our group has ran the data with Turner et al's The Gaussian Process Autoregressive Regression Model (GPAR), Slindernan et al.'s SSM model, and Wolff, et al.'s MOGPTK: The Multi-Output Gaussian Process Toolkit. Because our data cannot be open to the public, we have created synthetic data to run models, and have created examples of each in our Example Folder](/Example).

## Information
Example for four models can be found at [Example Folder](/Example)
